# My Zsh Config

Repository to store my .zshrc file settings

## What is a .zshrc file?

.zshrc is a Zsh shell script that Zsh runs whenever it is started interactively. It initializes an interactive shell session. You can put any command in that file that you could type at the command prompt.

You put commands here to set up the shell for use in your particular environment, or to customize things to your preferences. A common thing to put in .zshrc are aliases that you want to always be available.
